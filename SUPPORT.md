# Support for AzuraCast

Having trouble with your AzuraCast installation? These pointers may be able to help.

If you still don't find what you're looking for, check the GitHub Issues section for an existing issue relating to the 
one you're experiencing. If one does not exist, create a new one.

## Troubleshooting by Viewing Logs

Before submitting any GitHub issues, you should take a look at the terminal logs that AzuraCast outputs. They can often provide additional information about the error, or include very useful information that should be included in any GitHub issue you create.

Users with the appropriate permissions can also view many logs directly through AzuraCast itself. The Log Viewer feature is available under "Utilities" in each station's management page.

#### Docker

To view logs in Docker, from the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

This command will show you a running log of all containers. You can also get detailed logs by running `docker-compose logs -f service`, where "service" is one of `web`, `stations`, `nginx`, etc.

#### Traditional

Since the Traditional installation interacts directly with your host server, its logs are in various locations across the system.

- AzuraCast: `/var/azuracast/www_tmp/azuracast.log`
- Nginx Access: `/var/azuracast/www_tmp/access.log`
- Nginx Errors: `/var/azuracast/www_tmp/error.log`
- PHP: `/var/azuracast/www_tmp/php_errors.log`
- Supervisord: `/var/azuracast/www_tmp/supervisord.log`
- Redis: `/var/log/redis/redis-server.log`
- MariaDB: `/var/log/mysql`
- InfluxDB: `/var/log/influxdb`

For each station, logs for radio software will be inside `/var/azuracast/stations/{station_short_name}/config`, with the following filenames:

- Liquidsoap: `liquidsoap.log`
- Icecast: `icecast.log`
- SHOUTcast: `sc_serv.log`

## Common Solutions

### Reset an Account Password

If you have lost the password to log into an account, but still have access to the SSH terminal for the server, you can
execute the following command to generate a new random password for an account in the system.

Replace `YOUREMAILADDRESS` with the e-mail address whose password you intend to reset.

##### Docker

```bash
# With the Docker Utility Script
./docker.sh cli azuracast:account:reset-password YOUREMAILADDRESS

# Manually using Docker Compose
docker-compose run --rm cli azuracast_cli azuracast:account:reset-password YOUREMAILADDRESS
``` 

##### Traditional

```bash
php /var/azuracast/www/util/cli.php azuracast:account:reset-password YOUREMAILADDRESS
```

### Manually Flush the System Cache

Many parts of the AzuraCast system depend on caches to speed up site performance. Sometimes, these caches can get out of
date, and they may cause errors. You can always flush all site-wide caches using one command-line script:

```bash
# With the Docker Utility Script
./docker.sh cli cache:clear

# Manually using Docker Compose
docker-compose run --rm cli azuracast_cli cache:clear
``` 

##### Traditional

```bash
php /var/azuracast/www/util/cli.php cache:clear
```

### Access Files via SFTP (Docker Installations)

By default, SFTP access isn't set up for Docker based installations. If you have a large volume of media files, you may 
prefer to upload them via SFTP instead of using the web updater. You should *not* use the host operating system's SFTP,
however, as Docker stores station media inside a Docker-specific volume.

The script below will set up a temporary SFTP server that points to your station media directory inside Docker. The server
will stay running inside the terminal window, so you can easily hit `Ctrl+C` to terminate it when you are finished.

##### Docker
```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v azuracast_station_data:/home/azuracast/stations \
    -p 2222:22 atmoz/sftp:alpine \
    azuracast:4zur4c457:1000::stations
```

As long as you leave this script running, it will create a connection that you can access with these credentials:

* **Host:** Your server's host name
* **Port:** `2222` (Set in the third line)
* **Username:** `azuracast` (The first part of the last line)
* **Password:** `4zur4c457` (The second part of the last line) 

If you intend to leave this script running for long term periods, you must change the password to something more secure.

### Force a Full Update (Traditional Installations)

Normally, the traditional installer's update script only updates the portion of the system that have been modified since
your last update. If an update was interrupted or otherwise is causing trouble, you can force the update script to process
all components, which can often fix any issues:

##### Traditional

```bash
./update.sh --full
```

### Use Non-standard Ports

You may want to serve the AzuraCast web application itself on a different port, or host your radio station on a port that 
isn't within the default range AzuraCast serves (8000-8999).

#### Docker

To change the ports on which AzuraCast serves HTTP and HTTPS traffic, you can edit the `.env` file on the host to modify the public-facing port numbers as needed. (Note: this file should already exist on your system, but if it doesn't, you can [use this version for reference](https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/blob/master/.env).)

Modify (or create) the lines below to modify your port mappings:

```
AZURACAST_HTTP_PORT=80
AZURACAST_HTTPS_PORT=443
```

You can either specify a single number (i.e. 8080) for each value, or specify "127.0.0.1:8080" to only listen on the localhost. This can be useful when AzuraCast is hosted behind a proxy on your host.

You will need to recycle your Docker containers using `docker-compose down`, then `docker-compose up -d` to apply any changes made to this file.

To override more complex functionality in your Docker installation, see the "Customizing Docker" section below.

#### Traditional

To modify the port your web application runs on, modify the configuration file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/00-azuracast`.
Note that some updates may overwrite this file.

You can specify any port in any range for your station to use, provided the port isn't already in use.

By default, AzuraCast installs and enables the ufw (uncomplicated firewall) and sets it to lock down traffic to only SSH 
and the ports used by AzuraCast. If you're using a nonstandard port, you will likely also want to enable incoming traffic
on that port using the command `ufw allow PORTNUM`, where `PORTNUM` is the new port number.

### Customizing Docker

Docker installations come with four files by default:

- `docker.sh`, the [Docker Utility Script](https://www.azuracast.com/docker_sh.html);
- `.env`, which contains environment variables used by Docker Compose itself;
- `azuracast.env`, which contains customizable environment variables sent to AzuraCast and related services; and
- `docker-compose.yml`, a large file that defines all of the services used by AzuraCast and how they interact.

For power users looking to customize or expand their Docker configuration, you should follow these best practices:

- Do not modify or replace the `docker.sh` utility script.

- When updating (using the `docker.sh` utility script), it is recommended to run `./docker-sh update-self` before running `./docker.sh update`, to ensure the Docker Utility Script itself is up to date before it updates your Docker installation.

- Environment variables set in `.env` are only used by Docker Compose itself, and aren't passed directly into the AzuraCast containers. You should only modify this file to change the HTTP and HTTPS port mappings used by Nginx (see the "Use Non-Standard Ports" section above).

- The `azuracast.env` file is specific to your environment and can be customized however you like. It will not be replaced during any updates. Once your database has been created, however, changing the password listed in this file will cause the system to fail. If you want to destructively wipe your existing database and other files and set up a new one with the updated password, add the `-v` flag to the end of `docker-compose down` to remove all existing volumes, including your database.

- If possible, you should not directly modify `docker-compose.yml`, as some updates may modify how it is defined to resolve bugs or add new features. When updating, you will always be asked if you want to update this file; if you have not modified it, you should always do so.

- Instead of modifying `docker-compose.yml`, you can create a file named `docker-compose.override.yml` with your customizations. The structure of this file is the same as the main `docker-compose.yml` file, and is automatically parsed by Docker Compose to override any definitions in the main file. Updates will not replace this file.
